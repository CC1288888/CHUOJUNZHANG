# What is it
       This prototype can generate abstractive summary for an image set.
       The summary can consist of one or several sentences according to model applied.
       It is designed to deal with two scenarios for people posting images online:
       1. while People post a story on social media with similar type of image e.g., image of the same scene
          but don't know what to write
       2. while People browse other social media accounts which contains various images, but want a quick understanding
          of what inside their albums.
